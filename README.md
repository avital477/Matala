**Introduction:**
The program gets folder and takes all the CSV files exported from the app Wigle Wifi,   
and make a new CSV file that has all the Wifi networks sorted by signal, time and place.  
Then the program takes the new CSV file and convert it to KML file that can be shown on Google Earth, as pins of networks and also shows the time line.
When the program created the KML file it asked the user for a way to filter the networks - by time, ID or location.
